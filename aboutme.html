                    <h2> Where I Started </h2>
                    <p> I got my first ever GUNPLA kit on Christmas in 2020 and ever since then I have been hooked. My
                        first ever GUNPLA was TERTIUM (MSF-007TE) which I picked out as a Christmas gift, from my dad.
                        Since then I have built upwards of 20 GUNPLA kits and even more kits similar to GUNPLA by
                        Bandai. This hobby is a passion of mine which I dont see myself quitting any time soon (unless
                        my credit card gives up on it).</p>

                    <h2> Why I love Gundams </h2>
                    <p>Gundams were introduced in 1979 through the anime tv series, "Mobile Suit Gundam". I was not
                        around during that time but Gundams have been in media ever since, and I got hooked in by the
                        series, "Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS" and have been in love with Gundams ever since.

                    <h2> My Favorite Gunpla </h2>
                    <p> Even after building a large assortment of GUNPLA, my favorite will always be the HG RGM 96X
                        JESTA. Since discovering the JESTA GUNPLA, I have been in love with the: color pallet, design,
                        and build quality. For being a HG GUNPLA, its articulation has held up 3 years later. I find
                        myself always revisiting the GUNDAM and displaying it in various ways. My favorite way to
                        display it is in a fighting stance while dual wielding pink lightsabers. </p>

                <h2>LOOKING TO START? ... </h2>
                <p>While building a GUNPLA kit can look intimidating, there are many resources on YouTube which can help
                    you through every step. My reccomendation is starting with an ENTRY GRADE RX 78-2 kit. But be
                    careful, this hobby is addicting and there is an endless rabit-hole that awaits.</p>
