                    <h2> Origins </h2>
                    <p> The Mobile Suit Gundam Model Series (also known as First Gundam) is a line of Gunpla kits of the
                        Mobile Weapons from the TV series Mobile Suit Gundam. Released in 1980 following the end of the
                        series' initial broadcast run in Japan, the line introduced fans to the hobby of Gunpla.</p>

                    <h2> Grades </h2>
                    <p>GUNPLA come in various shapes, sizes, and GRADES. GUNPLA go up in quality, price, and size
                        depending on the grades (in ascending order): SD, HG, RG, MG, PG. The highest Grade is PG which
                        stands for PERFECT GRADE. The higher you go up in grade, the more time consuming the build
                        process is aswell.</p>

                    <h2> Building </h2>
                    <p>Building GUNPLA is a fun and rewarding experience. Within each kit is a detailed instruction
                        manual which clearly illustrates and guides you along the way. The closest comparison is LEGOs
                        and the guide books that come with them. Many GUNPLA builders even choose to custom paint their
                        GUNPLA to add even more personalization.</p>
